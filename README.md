# donders_reaction_task
The Donders reaction time experiment is a foundational study in cognitive psychology that measures reaction times (RT) under different conditions to infer the time taken for various mental processes, such as stimulus detection, discrimination, and response selection.
It involves three main tasks:

Task A: Simple Reaction Time - Detect a single stimulus and respond as quickly as possible (e.g., press a key when a shape appears).
Task B: Choice Reaction Time - Discriminate between multiple stimuli and select the appropriate response (e.g., press different keys for different colors).
Task C: Discrimination Reaction Time - Discriminate between stimuli but respond only to one (e.g., go/no-go: respond to one color, ignore the other).

By subtracting average RTs (e.g., B - A for response selection time, C - A for discrimination time), students can analyze cognitive processing stages.
